> **TLDR** I am a teacher and teacher educator from New England (USA) who approaches life with a bit of uncontrolled enthusiasm balanced out with a hefty dose of snark. In addition to my consulting and professional development workshops, I am an adjunct professor of education and just wrapped up a year at a Kenyan primary school working on instructional/programatic design and implementation within the PYP (International Baccalaureate) framework.

On the list of things that Eric finds particularly odd, writing about himself in the third person is certainly up there near the top. Eric has a B.A. in Music, an M.F.A. in Acting, and an M.Ed. In Elementary Curriculum and Instruction. His doctorate is forthcoming when he moves back to the US from Kenya. His current research interests include how we teach elementary students to communicate both in person and over technology, new literacies, reforming the methodologies for the teaching of systematic to pre-service teachers, and culturally responsive education practices through the lens of formalized prosody instruction. More than anything, though, he loves coffee, pizza and strawberry shortcake. Not together butâ€¦ well now as heâ€™s typing this he wondersâ€¦

Eric has had a storied career spanning work in the performative and creative arts as well public education and reform. His past experiences include teaching and consultancy work with George Mason University, Fairfax County Public Schools, the Denver Center, the AmeriCorps, Google, Chipotle, Greylock Partners, True Ventures, and throughout the photography industry.

Eric has received a number of recognitions for his teaching as well as leadership and academic achievements. Before entering elementary education, Eric ran his nationally recognized photography business which involved coaching and mentoring both adult and young photographers, meeting client needs, and managing a team of professionals, all while balancing an intense international shooting schedule. In the classroom, he has guided his students in the creation of their own audiobook library, the development of characters that gave us historical tours in A/VR, the designing of marketing materials for those historical guided tours, and the production of podcasts as a part of a recent PBL for ocean conservation.

Currently his family is in foreign service in Nairobi, Kenya where he is building an instructional framework with a local school, consulting, and instructional coaching. At some point his family will return to the US... ðŸ‡°ðŸ‡ª
