On the list of things that Eric finds particularly odd, writing about himself in the third person is certainly up there near the top. Eric has a B.A. in Music, an M.F.A. in Acting, and an M.Ed. In Elementary Curriculum and Instruction. His doctorate is forthcoming when he moves back to the US from Kenya. His current research interests include how we teach elementary students to communicate both in person and over technology, new literacies, reforming the methodologies for the teaching of systematic to pre-service teachers, and culturally responsive education practices through the lens of formalized prosody instruction. More than anything, though, he loves coffee, pizza and strawberry shortcake. Not together but… well now as he’s typing this he wonders… |![eric in a tie](/images/IMG_3298.JPG)

Eric has had a storied career spanning work in the performative and creative arts as well public education and reform. His past experiences include teaching and consultancy work with George Mason University, Fairfax County Public Schools, the Denver Center, the AmeriCorps, Google, Chipotle, Greylock Partners, True Ventures, and throughout the photography industry.

Seriously though, I am a teacher and teacher educator from New England who approaches life with a bit of uncontrolled enthusiasm balanced out with a hefty dose of snark. Maybe you’d like to peek at my 3-word education philiosophies?

# Objectives

2. To provide financial information that is useful to existing and potential investors, lenders and other creditors in making decisions about providing resources to the reporting entity.

> The ingredients of relevance are the predictive value and confirmatory value.

Information is considered material if its omission or misstatement could influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of the financial statements.

## Casual Bio

On the list of things that Eric finds particularly odd, writing about himself in the third person is certainly up there near the top. That aside, he is particularly required excited to share some information about himself with you. In his formalized education, Eric has a B.A. in Music, an M.F.A. In Acting, and an M.Ed. In Elementary Curriculum and Instruction. Chances are very good that he will continue collecting degrees for some time as he has yet to come close to curing his case of Curiosities. His current research interests include how we teach elementary students to communicate both in person and over technology, reforming the methodologies for the teaching of systematic action research to pre-service teachers, and culturally responsive education practices through the lens of formalized prosody instruction. More than anything, though, he loves coffee, pizza and strawberry shortcake. Not together but... well now as he's typing this he wonders...

Eric has had a storied career spanning work in the performative and creative arts as well public education and reform. His past experiences include work with George Mason University, Fairfax County Public Schools, the Denver Center, the AmeriCorps, and the photography industry. 

Eric has received a number of recognitions for his teaching as well as leadership and academic achievements. Before entering elementary education, Eric ran ran his nationally recognized photography business that involved coaching and mentoring both adult and young photographers, meeting client needs, and managing a team of professionals, all while balancing an intense shooting schedule.

## Enhancing Qualitative Characteristics

Verifiability implies consensus between the different knowledgeable and independent users of financial information. Such information must be supported by sufficient evidence to follow the principle of objectivity.

### Comparability

### Understandability

Understandability means that accounting reports should be expressed as clearly as possible and should be understood by those to whom the information is relevant.
Timeliness: Timeliness implies that financial information must be presented to the users before a decision is to be made.

## Statement of cash flows

The statement of cash flows considers the inputs and outputs in concrete cash within a stated period. The general template of a cash flow statement is as follows: Cash Inflow - Cash Outflow + Opening Balance = Closing Balance

| Cash Inflow | Outflow   | Opening Balance |
| ----------- | --------- | --------------- |
| _Monday_    | `Tuesday` | **Wednesday**   |
| 1           | 2         | 3               |

**Example 1:** in the beginning of September, Ellen started out with $5 in her bank account. During that same month, Ellen borrowed $20 from Tom. At the end of the month, Ellen bought a pair of shoes for $7. Ellen's cash flow statement for the month of September looks like this:

- Cash inflow: $20
- Cash outflow:$7
- Opening balance: $5
- Closing balance: $20 – $7 + $5 = $18

**Example 2:** in the beginning of June, WikiTables, a company that buys and resells tables, sold 2 tables. They'd originally bought the tables for $25 each, and sold them at a price of $50 per table. The first table was paid out in cash however the second one was bought in credit terms. WikiTables' cash flow statement for the month of June looks like this:

> **Important:** the cash flow statement only considers the exchange of actual cash, and ignores what the person in question owes or is owed.

Owner's equity, sometimes referred to as net assets, is represented differently depending on the type of business ownership. Business ownership can be in the form of a sole proprietorship, partnership, or a corporation. For a corporation, the owner's equity portion usually shows common stock, and retained earnings (earnings kept in the company). Retained earnings come from the retained earnings statement, prepared prior to the balance sheet.
