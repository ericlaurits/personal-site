Providing opportunities for teacher growth is vital for any school ecosystem. Professional development is most effective when it is driven by teacher agency, relevant and timely, and aligns with the values of your school.

## For the Love of Teachers

Teachers are my favorite people in the world. As I am still in and out of the classroom on a yearly basis, I pride myself on maintaining a strong connection to working teachers and current best practices. We are in the trenches together. No teacher (I can tell you from personal experience) wants to hear PD from a teacher who hasn't been in the classroom in the past decade. Below you'll find the topics of my most recent workshops, though every school I work with gets custom designed workshops built specifically for them and their needs. The topics most requested from me are: relationship building, growing a culture of reading, teacher language, inquiry design, questioning, project based learning (PBL), math workshop, writing instruction...

## Teacher Language

The most foundational bedrock of teaching craft, improving and unifying teacher language alone can transform not only an individual's pedagogy, but an entire school culture. The research behind this workshop, which is typically done as a full day in two sessions or two separate sessions sessions on different days throughout the year, is drawn from the work of [Peter Johnston](https://www.albany.edu/education/faculty/peter-johnston), [Paula Denton and Responsive Classroom](https://www.responsiveclassroom.org/product/power-of-our-words/), [William Ayers](https://billayers.org/writings/to-teach/), [Learning for Justice](https://www.learningforjustice.org), and many other experts at the intersection of teaching and linguistics.

## Designing the Learning Environment

How do we as educators and stewards of children's aspirations set up and design our physical learning space for maximum impact? How can we do more with less? This workshop is designed to walk teachers and administrators through the process of designing their space. It is hands on, practical, works with what existing resources your school has available, and by the time the workshop is over, teachers are ready to facilitate their students' learning knowing their space has been designed for student agency, the various approaches to instruction that match their school's approach to pedagogy, and responsive instruction.

## Making Workshop Happen

Inquiry and Workshop are the two sides of the differentiation/responsive teaching coin. We know the research on inquiry and agency, and we know the research on providing scaffolded structure for children. Trying to wrap the brain around how to design and facilitate both can be a struggle for even the most experienced teachers among us. These sessions center around designing, running, and managing the (math, reading, writing) workshop model and is rooted in both Self Determination Theory as well as Cognitive Load Theory and examines how to implement various approaches to lesson design based on the needs of the student and philosophies of learning at your school. Particularly popular in PYP and MYP schools, where we constantly extoll the virtues of inquiry but struggle to equip teachers with concrete approaches to learning design, these sessions leave teachers with actionable skeletal plans that map across disciplines and articulate vertically and that provide the school with a common language of learning design.

## The Interactive Read Aloud

The days of simply reading out loud to our students are (or should be) well behind us as educators. The Interactive Read Loud workshop equips teachers and librarians with the skills and framework to, should they desire, teacher every single literacy lesson through read aloud. It also prepares educators design their SEL lessons around IRL as well as drive inquiry through math in their read alouds. We have moved beyond 'Turn and Talk' and into 'Double up and Discuss.' When this workshop is finished, every participant will know how to evaluate the effectiveness of a text for their desired outcomes, where and how to craft discussion opportunities, and how to 'think outloud' while reading like a writer. Every participant designs an IRA for use the following week directly tied to one of their lesson objectives.
