Providing opportunities for teacher growth is vital for any school ecosystem. Professional development is most effective when it is driven by teacher agency, relevant and timely, and aligns with the values of your school.

## Teacher Language

The most foundational bedrock of teaching craft, improving and unifying teacher language alone can transform not only an individual's pedagogy, but an entire school culture. The research behind this workshop, which is typically done as a full day in two sessions or two separate sessions sessions on different days throughout the year, is drawn from the work of [Peter Johnston](https://www.albany.edu/education/faculty/peter-johnston), [Paula Denton and Responsive Classroom](https://www.responsiveclassroom.org/product/power-of-our-words/), [William Ayers](https://billayers.org/writings/to-teach/), [Learning for Justice](https://www.learningforjustice.org), and many other experts at the intersection of teaching and linguistics.


## Designing your Learning Environment

How do we as educators and stewards of children's aspirations set up and design our physical learning space for maximum impact? How can we do more with less? This workshop is designed to walk teachers and administrators through the process of designing their space. It is hands on, practical, works with what existing resources your school has available, and by the time the workshop is over, teachers are ready to facilitate their students' learning knowing their space has been designed for student agency, the various approaches to instruction that match their school's approach to pedagogy, and responsive instruction.


## The Interactive Read Aloud

The days of simply reading out loud to our students are (or should be) well behind us as educators. The Interactive Read Loud workshop equips teachers and librarians with the skills and framework to, should they desire, teacher every single literacy lesson through read aloud. It prepares educators design their SEL lessons around the read aloud as well as drive inquiry through math in their read alouds. We have moved beyond 'Turn and Talk' and into 'Double up and Discuss.' When this workshop is finished, every participant will know how to evaluate the effectiveness of a text for their desired outcomes, where and how to craft discussion opportunities, and how to 'think outloud' while reading like a writer. Every participant creates and designs an IRA for use the following week directly tied to one of their lesson objectives.
